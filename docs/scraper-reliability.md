# Scraper Reliability

## Reliability Controls
- Retailer adapters run through a shared reliability guard before Playwright navigation.
- Redis-backed rate limiting uses `ratelimit:scraper:<retailer>` keys to cap scrape volume per minute.
- Redis-backed circuit state uses:
  - `circuit:scraper:<retailer>`
  - `circuit:failures:scraper:<retailer>`
- Transient scraper failures retry with exponential backoff plus jitter.
- Auth/session-dependent delivery scrapes fail as structured `scraper_not_ready` results instead of crashing the worker.

## Failure Isolation
- One retailer failure returns a safe task status and does not abort other queued retailer work.
- The circuit breaker opens after `SCRAPER_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` consecutive failures for the cooldown window.
- Successful scrapes reset the retailer circuit state.

## Logging and Debugging
- Task logs include retailer, order/order-item ID, status, and error detail.
- Normalized scrape payloads carry `raw_payload` metadata for later inspection.
- Missing authenticated Playwright storage state is treated as an expected operational gap, not an unhandled exception.

## Operational Notes
- Product price pages are public-path friendly.
- Nike and Sephora delivery polling works best with authenticated Playwright storage state files in `PLAYWRIGHT_STORAGE_STATE_DIR`.
- Amazon is implemented as a price adapter only in this repository.
