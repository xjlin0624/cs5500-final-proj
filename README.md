# CS5500 Final Project: AfterCart

*Group 1: Yingchao Cai, Bo Hu, Xuelan Lin, Weiyi Sun*

AfterCart is a post-purchase assistant that aggregates orders, monitors price and delivery risks, and helps users decide whether to wait, contact support, cancel, return, or rebuy.

## Stack

- Backend: `FastAPI`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Alembic`, `Celery`, `Redis`, `Postgres`
- Frontend: `React`, `Vite`
- Scraping: `Playwright` retailer adapters for Nike and Sephora price checks and delivery polling
- Notifications and observability: `Firebase Cloud Messaging`, `Sentry`
- Deployment targets: `Render` for backend services and `Vercel` for the dashboard

## Functional Scope

### MVP

1. Cross-retailer order aggregation
2. Price drop and better-deal monitoring
3. Delivery anomaly detection and Plan B recommendations
4. Decision-confidence visualization
5. Customer-support message assistance

### Stretch Goals (not pursued)

6. Personalized recommendation tuning

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python `3.12+`
- Node.js `20+`
- Docker Desktop if you want the full local stack with Postgres, Redis, and Celery

### Initial Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Review `.env` and add secrets only if you need those integrations locally:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` for message generation
- `SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` for Sentry
- Firebase credentials for browser push
- Playwright storage-state files for authenticated retailer pages

### Start the Local Platform (API + Frontend without Docker)

Use this mode only if you already have reachable Postgres and Redis instances configured in `.env`.

**Terminal 1 - Backend**

```bash
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

> First time setup: run migrations before starting the API server.
> ```bash
> cd backend && alembic upgrade head
> ```

### Start the Full Platform (local Postgres + Redis + API + worker + beat)

```bash
docker compose up --build postgres redis api worker beat
```

This brings up:

- Postgres on `localhost:5432`
- Redis on `localhost:6379`
- FastAPI on `http://localhost:8000`
- Celery worker
- Celery Beat scheduler

This is the default local validation path used by the repo. If you prefer managed Postgres/Redis instead, override `.env` and run the API/frontend without Docker.

### Seed Demo Data

```bash
cd backend && python seed.py
```

To reset and reseed:

```bash
cd backend && python seed.py --reset
```

Seed accounts: `alice@example.com` / `bob@example.com`, password: `password123`

### Chrome Extension

Load the `extension/` folder in Chrome Developer Mode. The popup sign-in screen lets you set the backend API base URL, so local (`http://localhost:8000/api`) and deployed environments can be used without code edits. Chrome will request host access for the configured API origin the first time you save a new backend target.

Current extension retailer support:

- Nike: order-page and product-page capture
- Sephora: order-page and product-page capture

## Retailer Support Matrix

| Surface | Nike | Sephora |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extension order capture | Supported | Supported |
| Extension product-page price capture | Supported | Supported |
| Backend price checks | Supported | Supported |
| Backend delivery polling | Supported (requires authenticated Playwright storage state) | Supported (requires authenticated Playwright storage state) |

## Manual Backend Commands

Install dependencies into a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

Run tests and linting:

```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests
python -m ruff check backend
```

Useful Celery entrypoints:

```bash
celery -A backend.app.workers.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=INFO
celery -A backend.app.workers.celery_app.celery_app beat --loglevel=INFO
```

## Health and Verification

- API health: `GET /api/health`
- API readiness: `GET /api/health/ready`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` in development

Recommended verification commands:

```bash
docker compose config
python -m pytest backend/tests
python -m ruff check backend
python backend/scripts/validate_price_check_performance.py --items 100 --target-seconds 300
python backend/scripts/measure_dashboard_load.py --url http://localhost:5173/dashboard --target-ms 2000 --headless
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Environment Variables

The canonical variable reference lives in [.env.example](.env.example). Key groups:

- platform, database, cache
- auth
- Celery schedules
- Sentry
- Playwright and scraper reliability
- Gemini cache and rate limits
- Firebase and FCM
- Render and Vercel deployment URLs
- frontend `VITE_*` build-time config

## Deployment

- Backend services and managed data stores are described in [render.yaml](render.yaml)
- Frontend deployment assumptions live in [vercel.json](vercel.json)
- CI and deploy automation live under `.github/workflows/`
- Production configuration requirements and Phase 4 validation status are summarized in [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md) and [docs/student-b-handoff.md](docs/student-b-handoff.md)

## Notes

- Browser push no-ops safely until Firebase credentials are configured.
- Delivery polling for Nike and Sephora uses Playwright storage-state files when authenticated retailer pages are required.
- Amazon retailer integration is a deprioritized stretch goal — not part of this build.
- Savings, Subscriptions, Dashboard summaries, and extension popup savings now use real backend data paths.
- The dashboard price-history section renders real item history when available and falls back to an empty state when no history exists yet.
