# CS5500 Final Project: AfterCart

*Group 1: Yingchao Cai, Bo Hu, Xuelan Lin, Weiyi Sun*

AfterCart is a post-purchase assistant that aggregates orders, monitors price and delivery risks, and helps users decide whether to wait, contact support, cancel, return, or rebuy.

## Stack

- Backend: `FastAPI`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Alembic`, `Celery`, `Redis`, `Postgres`
- Frontend: `React`, `Vite`
- Scraping: `Playwright` retailer adapters for Nike, Sephora, and Amazon price checks
- Notifications/observability: `Firebase Cloud Messaging`, `Sentry`
- Deployment targets: `Render` for backend services and `Vercel` for the dashboard

## Functional Scope

### MVP

1. Cross-retailer order aggregation
2. Price drop and better-deal monitoring
3. Delivery anomaly detection and Plan B recommendations
4. Decision-confidence visualization
5. Customer-support message assistance

### Stretch Goals

6. Personalized recommendation tuning
7. Amazon retailer integration

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python `3.12+`
- Node.js `20+`
- Docker Desktop (only needed if running Celery workers locally)

### Initial Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to your Neon connection string. Review `.env` and add secrets only if you need those integrations locally:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` for message generation
- `SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` for Sentry
- Firebase credentials for browser push
- Playwright storage-state files for authenticated retailer pages

### Start the Local Platform (Neon Postgres, no Docker)

Since Postgres runs on Neon, you only need to run the API server and frontend locally.

**Terminal 1 — Backend:**

```bash
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

> First time setup: run migrations before starting the API server.
> ```bash
> cd backend && alembic upgrade head
> ```

### Start the Full Platform (with Celery workers, requires Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build redis api worker beat
```

This brings up:

- Redis on `localhost:6379`
- FastAPI on `http://localhost:8000`
- Celery worker
- Celery Beat scheduler

Note: the `api` service in docker-compose uses a hardcoded local Postgres URL — update `docker-compose.yml` if you want it to use Neon.

### Seed Demo Data

```bash
cd backend && python seed.py
```

To reset and reseed:

```bash
cd backend && python seed.py --reset
```

Seed accounts: `alice@example.com` / `bob@example.com`, password: `password123`

### Chrome Extension

Load the `extension/` folder in Chrome Developer Mode and point it at the same API base URL as the dashboard.

## Manual Backend Commands

Install dependencies into a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

Run tests and linting:

```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests
python -m ruff check backend
```

Useful Celery entrypoints:

```bash
celery -A backend.app.workers.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=INFO
celery -A backend.app.workers.celery_app.celery_app beat --loglevel=INFO
```

## Health and Verification

- API health: `GET /api/health`
- API readiness: `GET /api/health/ready`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` in development

Recommended verification commands:

```bash
docker compose config
python -m pytest backend/tests
python -m ruff check backend
python backend/scripts/validate_price_check_performance.py --items 100 --target-seconds 300
python backend/scripts/measure_dashboard_load.py --url http://localhost:5173/dashboard --target-ms 2000 --headless
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Environment Variables

The canonical variable reference lives in [.env.example](.env.example). Key groups:

- platform/database/cache
- auth
- Celery schedules
- Sentry
- Playwright/scraper reliability
- Gemini cache/rate limits
- Firebase/FCM
- Render/Vercel deployment URLs
- frontend `VITE_*` build-time config

## Deployment

- Backend services and managed data stores are described in [render.yaml](render.yaml)
- Frontend deployment assumptions live in [vercel.json](vercel.json)
- CI and deploy automation live under `.github/workflows/`

## Notes

- Browser push no-ops safely until Firebase credentials are configured.
- Delivery polling for Nike/Sephora uses Playwright storage-state files when authenticated retailer pages are required.
- Amazon is implemented as a price-only adapter in this pass.
- The Savings page fetches real data from `GET /api/savings/summary`. Subscriptions and the dashboard price chart still use placeholder data.
